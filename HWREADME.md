In this repository, I have a homework assignment where I was instructed to write a program where 
a String array of inputs would be taken in, and whether the Strings started with a 'B', or the first letter of a coin,
a constructor would be called from a child class of either the Coin or Bill classes, and create objects with the value passed in.
I then printed out the total sum of the wallet, rewriting a toString method so the output would come out in a presentable format.

Feel free to check out the project I completed in the Project 1 repository :)
